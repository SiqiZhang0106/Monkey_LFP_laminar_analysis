# Monkey_LFP_laminar_analysis

Task-related epochs in the following analysis: Baseline, Target onset, Go cue, Reach onset, Enter target, Return on, Return peak

#Epoched_PSD_fooof: aims to calculate the laminar PSD and also remove the aperiodic components by FOOOF. The oscillatory power and aperiodic parameters (offset and slope could be found changing in different electrode depths (layers), and also changing in different epochs.

#Epoched_beta_average_trials: provides the time-frequency analysis by Superlets algorithm, then tries to extract the power in beta frequency band (13-30)Hz, and finally plots the distribution of beta power from the superficial to deep layers by a gradient figure.
